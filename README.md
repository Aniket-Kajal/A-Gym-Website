# A-Gym-Website

Created this website as a part of personal project of a gym but it was a practical experience for me. My uncle who 
is a gym trainer and owns a gym asked me to make a sample website for his gym. So, I gathered all the requirements 
from him, the content he wanted in his website, the photos , the webpages he wanted and made a basic layout of it 
and showed it to him and when he approved of it,I started designing the website and with him as the customer, I took
more details from him during the making and made minor changes he wanted.

Such a way, I was able to experience how it is some web developers in real life work .
